# Surya Digital Coding Assessment

This repository is where you will attempt your coding assessment for Surya Digital.

# PLEASE READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY AND COMPLETELY BEFORE STARTING

# IF INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT FOLLOWED EXACTLY, YOUR SUBMISSION WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.

> [!WARNING]
> I will repeat this: Please read all instructions carefully and completely before starting. We keep repeating ourselves on this topic, but every year we find that the majority of students do not read and follow instructions outlined for them. If instructions are not followed exactly, your submission will not be considered.

# Introduction & Instructions

The problems outlined here are “toy” problems, but please solve them in as professional a manner as you can. All the problems outlined in this repository are straightforward, and are not designed to “trick” you or trip you up. If you approach them systematically, you will be able to solve them. They are “toy” problems instead of real world problems to enable you to complete them in a relatively short amount of time.
In support of your work, feel free to look up documentation online.

## Problems

There are 3 problems defined in this repository:

- [music](music/README.md)
- [weather](weather/README.md)
- [PnL Calculator](pnl_calculator/README.md)

Each problem has a folder for it. The problem definition, and details on what is expected in each problem is in the README of each folder.

Each problem has been divided into “steps”, i.e., small features that can be completed one after the other, as they build incrementally on top of each other.

Please read all the problem statements before you start. Each of the problems is designed to leverage a different set of skills. **It is unlikely that you will have the time to take on more than one problem**. Pick the problem that is the best match for your abilities and skills, and solve it.

## Submission Process

You are free to use any framework/language/libraries of your choice. Common choices include (but are not limited to):

- Java
- Python
- Kotlin
- Swift
- Dart
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Ruby
- ReactJS
- Angular
- Flutter
- SwiftUI
- Jetpack Compose

You are not required to use one of the above - you are free to use any framework or language of your choice. If, however, you are using something not on the list above, please include clear instructions on how to run your project.

Put your solution within the specific folder of your problem. For example, if you are working on `music`, please put your entire solution under the `music` folder. If you put it at the root of the repository, or in any place other than the relevant problem folder, your solution will not be considered.

Please ensure that you _push_ your changes to the GitHub repository, to the `main` branch. If your final solution is not pushed to the `main` branch of the GitHub repository, your submission will not be considered.

## Evaluation Criteria

A working solution is only the first step of our evaluation criteria. If your solution does not work (i.e., we are not able to compile and run it successfully), your solution will not be considered.

There is no single “correct” solution to any of these problems. They are deliberately slightly open-ended to allow you room to make your own decisions and judgements. If you are meeting the requirements specified in the problem statement, your submission will be considered to be working.

If your solution runs successfully, you will receive a grade based primarily on the following factors:

- Code quality (clear structuring of code, proper naming, etc.)
- Hygiene (proper git usage, correct spelling & grammar, proper formatting, etc.)
- Attention to detail
- How many steps you successfully completed

We value quality over quantity. For example, solving 3 steps poorly will be graded lower than solving 2 steps well. Half-completed steps won't be considered for submission.
